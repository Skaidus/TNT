Rust implementation focused on performance of many Number Theory certificates: 
* **Primality:** [AKS Primality Test](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2004/160-2/p12) apart from multiple proposed optimizations.
* **Perfect Power Detection:** mostly algorithms by Daniel J. Bernstein:
  * [Detecting Perfect Powers in Essentially Linear Time](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1998-67-223/S0025-5718-98-00952-1/S0025-5718-98-00952-1.pdf).
